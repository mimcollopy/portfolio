        <p className="hi">Hi!</p>
        I'm Mim. I'm a naturally curious person with a knack for problem solving, and have recently completed General Assembly's software engineering bootcamp. <br />
        My background encompasses a unique blend of managing hospitality venues,
        organizing large events, and running my own e-commerce business.
        <br />
        These ventures have equipped me with a broad range of skills and a
        lateral thinking approach that allows me to excel in any environment.
        <br />
        I aim to develop user-centred solutions that integrate functionality,
        aesthetics, and great user experiences, and leave a positive impact.
        <br />
        I'm excited to continue to build projects - both solo and with others.
